# User Stories (MVP)

* As a market analyst, I want an app that displays potential products to focus groups and tells me which ones they are most likely to purchase.
* As a market analyst, I want the products displayed 3 at-a-time, allowing the focus group participants to choose the product that appeals to them most.
* As a market analyst, I want to see the data reported clearly and thoroughly.
* As a market analyst, I want to avoid influencing the focus group's selections by presenting the data to them too early. Results should not be shown to users until they have made 25 selections.

* As a developer, I want to use descriptive console.log()s throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging.
